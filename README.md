# heras-meal-plan-
This application was made as native Android app using Kotlin in Android Studio that offers meals based on the time of day. The goal was to develop a straightforward but efficient method that would make choosing a meal enjoyable and uncomplicated. The following is the app's functionality: The software must determine if it is breakfast, lunch, or dinnertime and offer meal suggestions in a visually appealing manner. I classified the current system time into one of the three lunch times using "if" statements. The application then makes a dynamic meal recommendation from a pre-made list using this information. Github version control is used to monitor development and guarantee code stability. I've been able to cooperate effectively and keep backups. I used Github for automated testing and development in order to maintain the app's dependability. This made guaranteed that every update was thoroughly tested before being released. The end product is a straightforward but effective meal recommendation tool that relieves Hera of the burden of making hurried food decisions. She can now rely on the app to provide her with dinner suggestions that suit the time of day whenever she's busy.
